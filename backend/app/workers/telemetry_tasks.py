"""
Celery task for the telemetry ingestion pipeline.

TelemetryService.ingest_events does real per-event work (domain
classification, sighting/incident creation, notification dispatch) -
for a full 500-event batch that adds up to more than an HTTP handler
should block on. Handing it to a worker means POST /shadow-ai/ingest
returns 202 immediately; the agent/extension don't wait for or poll the
result, so processing failures are surfaced only in this worker's own
logs and via whatever sightings/incidents do or don't show up - not
back to the caller.
